* List of dialogs, including tete-a-tete and group chats, markers for unread messages and last user message view
* List of messages (incoming and outcoming) with history pagination and already calculated dates headers
* Different avatars with no specific realization of image loading - you can use any library you want
* Selection mode for interacting with messages
